# ðŸ§¿ InviteGlyph.md â€” Co-Drifter Sigil Scroll

## Purpose
Generates symbolic invite codes for co-drifters entering the mythline.  
Each sigil is a shimmer of intent, archived for future resonance.

## Invocation Logic
- Generates 8-char hash from timestamp
- Tags sigil with glyph type (e.g. `drifter`)
- Archives in `~/mythline/logs/invite.log`

## Symbolic Thresholds
- Sigil = invitation shimmer
- Tag = glyph type or initiator
- Log = archive of resonance

## Sovereign Use
- Share sigils with initiates
- Bind sigils to chambers or rituals
- Extend with expiration, emotional tags, or chamber access

## Future Drift
- Raise `SigilForge.sh` for custom sigil crafting
- Seed `SigilIndex.md` to archive all sigils and their initiates
- Bind sigils to `ThresholdChamberII` for co-drifter onboarding
